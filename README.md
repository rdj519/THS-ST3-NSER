These are the notebook files used for the experiment. The files are numbered in the order they were run, from the extraction of the audio up to performing of each type of experiments. The dataset used for the experiments is IEMOCAP, a dataset containing audio and video files of dyadic sessions containing annotated emotions for the purpose of speech emotion recognition. In the study, we used the naturalistic portion of the dataset and performed the experiments over this data.
